left ) and someone else who i don ’ t know . i am not a regular viewer so i can ’ t say if the man on the right is an extra or an actual character .", "this picture has itself caused scandal in the uk , as it was a gay kiss that was broadcast before the watershed , and as such led to a number of complaints to the bbc . however , since this episode aired ( october 2008 ) christian now has a boyfriend and a few more gay kisses have taken place .", "in relation to the john snow kiss-in event , i used this particular photo because i considered it to be quite mild ( no groping , no tongues ) . the photos i had considered using before i chose that one are much more racy . oh the irony !", "secondly , the removal of the facebook john snow kiss-in event :", "it turns out that the facebook event for the john snow kiss-in was not blocked by facebook , but made private by the creator of the event itself . paul shetler , the organizer , left this comment on the previous thread :", "“hey i just saw this . before it goes too far , i just want people to know that fb have not removed the kiss-in event page ; it ’ s still there , but _i made the event private after the event_ was over and only visible to those who had been invited as there were starting to be trolls posting abusive nonsense on it. ”", "thanks for clearing that up , paul . now if facebook will only reply to richard ’ s query about why they removed my original post and photo when he put it up on his wall …", "it has been erroneously reported in the media that our own richard metzger ( who lives in los angeles ) organized the london “kiss-in ” event , which is untrue , and also unfair to paul shetler and the actual organizers . also , richard did not state in his post that facebook had taken the event page down , he just questioned if this was the case and if there was a connection with my post about the event being removed from his own wall . this seems to have confused some people .", "here is a report on the john snow kiss-in from the guardian , featuring an interview with mr shetler :", "updated : a photo of two men kissing that was posted on a facebook page protesting a london pub ’ s decision to eject a same-sex couple for kissing has been removed by the social networking site , an error , according to a rep for the company .", "\" the photo in question does not violate our

removed and the following e-mail was sent to administrators of the facebook page : “shares that contain nudity , or any kind of graphic or sexually suggestive content , are not permitted on facebook. ”", "the decision to remove the photo has prompted scores of people to post their own pictures of same-sex couples kissing in protest — dozens in the last few hours alone ."], "tgt_str": "it turns out facebook is only guilty of about half of what it ’ s been accused of in the gay kiss incident . the social networking site apologized yesterday for taking down an image used to promote a “kiss-in ” event in london . “the photo in question does not violate our statement of rights and responsibilities , and was removed in error , ” the site said in a statement , according to the advocate . but facebook did not , as has been reported in several places , take down the kiss-in event itself . here ’ s what happened : the photo facebook took down was posted by the dangerous minds blog to promote the event . in its initial write-up about the incident , the blog observed that the page organizing the protest had been taken down . but it was actually the organizer himself who \" removed \" the event , dangerous minds clarified . organizer paul shetler explains that he decided to switch it from a public event to a private one , as \" there were starting to be trolls posting abusive nonsense on it . \"", "sim_graph": [["1.0", "0.004336124", "0.003688164", "0.9999955", "0.0043766364", "0.008631637", "0.004596627", "0.0041952087", "0.0055585075", "0.0034476288", "0.007516141",

chambers tuesday for the discussion on whether the county should issue a declaration that it wants to secede from the state . nearly all those in attendance appeared to be for the move and about a dozen spoke in support of it .", "” many proposed laws are unconstitutional and deny us our god-given rights , ” said gabe garrison of happy camp . “we need our own state so we can make laws that fit our way of life. ”", "among those in attendance was erin ryan , field representative for rep.", "doug lamalfa . when asked for the congressman ' s opinion , she said that she and other lamalfa staff members supported the effort to secede , but she did not know lamalfa ' s thoughts on it .", "she also said there ' s support for the split in sacramento .", "the discussion also attracted members of groups from shasta and tehama counties who are looking for their own supervisors to pass similar declarations .", "” it would be the only way i could see everyone coming together in a positive manner , ” said tom moller of red bluff .", "also there was kayla brown , a mother in her early 20s , who said she didn ' t want to raise her child in california .", "” the state of jefferson is the place i want to raise my son , ” she said .", "at one point in the meeting a speaker asked for a show of hands from those in attendance who supported the split . nearly every hand in the room was raised .", "and supervisors echoed much of that enthusiasm in their own comments .", "” i haven ' t had one contact in regard to this issue , that ' s in opposition , ” supervisor michael kobseff said .", "supervisor marcia armstrong said the issues were about regulation , restriction of rights , lack of representation , regionalism and restoration of limited government .", "” we also have this enormous bureaucracy of unelected officials making decisions for us , ” she said .", "board chair ed valenzuela was the sole vote against the declaration . he said he was elected to solve problems within the system .", "” it comes down to because i took an oath . i took an oath when i ran for re-election , which i just did , and that was to uphold the constitution , and uphold the constitution of the state of california , ” he said . “and within that , and because knowing what it ' s like to be a minority , i know the value of having to work from the other side without the numbers and without support . i signed on to do that , i signed on to work within the system i know . i don ' t like it , i don ' t agree with it all the time but at the same token , i did sign up for that and i will continue to do so. ”", "in august , county residents lobbied the board to consider separating from the state over a laundry list of complaints including a lack of representation in sacramento for the republican-majority county , issues pertaining to water rights and the rural fire prevention fee .", "if the county were to split from the state , any action taken today would be the first step in a long process that would require approval from the state legislature and the u.s. congress .", "siskiyou county would also invite other neighboring counties in california and southern oregon to join in the effort to create a new state .", "the u.s. constitution allows for the formation of new states , though land can ' t be taken from existing states without the consent of state and federal governments .", "humboldt county 1st district supervisor rex bohn said he can understand the frustration in siskiyou county and that he tends to agree with most of the issues that were brought up by the board .", "” i was one of the people who thinks the state of jefferson wasn ' t a bad idea , ” bohn said . “there has been a total lack of respect in terms of our water rights and the fire fee . those things may not be important to the rest of the state , but it ' s important to us . this is a major thing for everyone that lives rurally. ”", "bohn said the problem is that only 16 percent of the state is rural , and decisions in sacramento are sometimes based on the needs or realities of more urban areas .", "” it ' s kind of a drastic measure to get someone to listen to you , but i guess they feel like they ' re not getting heard , ” he said .", "bohn added that the humboldt county supervisors will likely meet to discuss the issue .", "humboldt county 3rd district supervisor mark lovelace said he took the talk of secession as a statement of frustration .", "” there has to be basic economic underpinnings to make a state work , ” lovelace said . “there is a certain romantic appeal and allure to the state of jefferson , this entire idea of what could have been , but in reality it would not be good economically. ”", "he said one of the problems with a rural county seceding is that the tax base starts small .", "” siskiyou is one of the largest counties with one of the smallest populations , ” he said . “it is also full of state roads that they won ' t be able to maintain , and federal land. ”"], "tgt_str": "not a big fan of southern california ? neither is northern california , apparently . supervisors in rural siskiyou county voted 4-1 tuesday in favor of seceding from the state , reports the times-standard . the county thinks state officials in sacramento are too focused on the big metro areas of the south and thus want to form a state of its own — to be called jefferson . supporters want to invite other northern counties , and perhaps a few from oregon , to join , too , notes the los angeles times . ” we have to have government that ' s local , understands our issues , and has empathy , ” says one local rancher . it ' s clearly a very long-shot bid , one that would eventually require the blessing of both the state legislature and the us congress . still , neighboring humboldt county is expected to meet soon to consider the idea . ( meanwhile , some counties in colorado want to form a new state of their own. )", "sim_graph": [["1.0", "0.007868094", "0.0061827456", "0.009839128", "0.008984409", "0.0086712865", "0.010202356",

services strategy , but the joint company won ' t take the same form as apple .", "microsoft has been working on its evolution into a devices and services company , away from the services business it has traditionally been , for several years now with limited success .", "its acquisition of most of nokia is the latest acceleration of that strategy — to move further away from the moribund world of the beige desktop and towards the sunlit world of smartphones and tablets .", "owning the desktop ( via windows ) and building additional services on top , like office or search , has been vital for microsoft ' s strategy until now , so as our interest shifts from the desktop to the tablet or smartphone it ' s essential to microsoft ' s broader business ( even azure ) that it can retain that connection in some form . to be a winner in the business market it also has to be a winner in the consumer market , something that wasn ' t the case a decade ago .", "as microsoft ' s own presentation about the deal , announced on monday , notes : \" with the consumerisation of it user matter at both home and work ... we cannot risk having apple or google foreclose app innovation , integration , distribution or economics . \"", "nokia lashed itself to microsoft ' s mast after losing out to ios and android in the smartphone market share stakes and with the limited success of the lumia range so far enough to keep interest in windows phone alive , most analysts are seeing a certain amount of inevitability to the acquisition , even if they are split on what its biggest implications are .", "forrester mobile analyst charles golvin said the steadily diminishing investments by other windows phone licensees has left microsoft with just nokia as its standard bearer and added microsoft now appears \" poised to adopt a vertically integrated strategy more akin to apple ' s \" .", "but he said microsoft ' s challenge remains how to unite the myriad services and brands — windows , nokia , live , surface , xbox , bing and more — into a cohesive experience that will command and cement customer loyalty .", "\" that ' s a tall order and one that should weigh strongly on the board ' s choice of a new ceo , \" he said .", "richard holway , chairman of analyst techmarketview , said given that microsoft paid $ 8.5bn for skype in 2011 , the price it is paying for nokia \" seems extremely reasonable \" .", "however , he added : \" our only ' surprise ' now is the timing of the announcement . for such a big deal to come just days after ballmer stood down seems mighty strange . \"", "for holway , there is also an opportunity for the enlarged microsoft to step up its business mobility efforts : \" there is undoubtedly a market opportunity for the creation of a provider of mobile solutions for the enterprise . taking office onto various mobile platforms . providing secure emailing in a sector once occupied by blackberry . \"", "but such a move carries its own risks — microsoft ' s success has been build on being hardware agnostic and persuading device manufacturers to support it . already its move into the tablet market with surface will have unsettled its manufacturers which have struggled to come up with convincing form factors to tackle the decline of the pc . if nokia ' s rumoured tablet appears too , this will further complicate microsoft ' s relations with these partners who are essential for the success of windows 8 ( as well as office and other products ) .", "but , as holway points out , \" on balance , microsoft needed to make a bold move into mobile . not doing so would mean certain terminal decline . this way at least holds out some chance of survival . \"", "carolina milanesi , research vice president at analyst gartner , said by buying rather than just partnering with nokia , microsoft gets deeper integration , the benefit of its patents and removes any risk of nokia either going android or being acquired by someone else .", "but success against ios and android will depend on how the companies integrate .", "\" nokia benefits from higher r&d spend as well as more marketing budget . microsoft benefits from a good relationship with carriers , good direct channel presence in emerging markets , the potential of going after more aggressively to the business market , \" she told zdnet .", "but for milanesi , business is a secondary concern , even if it is an attractive target where microsoft , and to a less extent nokia , have experience : \" first and foremost it needs to be about consumers . enterprise are certainly a target especially considering the state blackberry is in but consumers make or break a phone vendor today . \"", "from milanesi ' s point of view , emerging markets need to be a longer term target for microsoft — but the battle needs to be won in the mature markets first .", "for forrester principal analyst thomas husson , nokia adds to microsoft ' s developing market strategy . it ' s looking increasingly likely that the us and western european smartphone market is reaching saturation , so that most growth will come from emerging markets . here nokia ' s asha devices could play a neat role as an ' on-ramp ' for consumers buying their first smartphone . tied in with a revamped tablet strategy this could open up a new front against android in particular .", "but husson cautioned : \" this is going to be a long journey . in some countries , windows phone 8 market share is now above five percent and close to 10 percent . it thus still offers a limited reach for developers and marketers .", "\" nokia is indeed still massivley popular in some emerging countries but competition is very high with far east manufacturers and low-cost android devices . i think it will depend on microsoft ' s new strategy for emerging markets beyond just mobile phones . \"", "all of this shows the number of competing — and occasionally contradictory — demands upon microsoft ' s management .", "as the incumbent player in a fading market , microsoft has a take into account those differing requirements as it tries to build for the future . for example , balancing microsoft ' s business customers against the need to get into consumer tech , the need to build its own hardware business against the need to keep manufacturers onside , and building up a mobile business while protecting its pc heritage .", "it ' s easy to look at apple ' s integrated hardware and software model and the rich ecosystem that sits around it , but it ' s much harder to emulate .", "global

which includes 1.65 billion euros in patents , is just 5.44 billion euros . it ' s been a rough decade .", "nokia ' s cell phone collapse has been a spectacular one . the finnish giant dominated the dumbphone era after motorola , another faded star that recently fell into the hands of a comparative upstart . but it was blindsided by apple , then deprived of a chance to regain its footing by an even more aggressive google , which followed close behind .", "the story , in hindsight , is simple : nokia did not have a truly compelling smartphone ready when a large segment of the developed world was first compelled by smartphones . whether this was the result of complacency — nokia was , in the mid-2000s , the leader of the niche smartphone category — doesn ' t matter now .", "nokia ' s miscalculations became impossible to ignore in 2008 , the same year microsoft decided , internally at least , to scrap its ancient and inadequate windows mobile platform in favor of something entirely new . under these circumstances , it ' s easy to imagine how a sort of camaraderie might have emerged at the time , or at least a mutual sympathy . certainly a shared interest : to break back into the market from which they had been unceremoniously expelled .", "during the next two years , while microsoft readied windows phone 7 and nokia floundered on , the seeds of sunday ' s deal were sewn . a chastened nokia was a natural partner for the tardy but determined microsoft ; it needed a software solution and microsoft needed help with hardware . the 2009 vision of 2013 renders clearly : two giants , united after some missteps , regain their rightful place . by 2010 , when the head of microsoft ' s business division left to take the helm at nokia , the gears were moving . many at the time wondered if stephen elop ' s time at nokia would be spent grooming the company for purchase — a foreigner in all possible ways , he began his time at the company with a memo rightly but offensively declaring nokia ' s proud platform a failure , and quickly pledged the company ' s commitment to the still-tiny windows phone . it felt like a radical about-face , but no matter : nokia and microsoft were going to save each other .", "now , with elop returning to microsoft after a job well done — well , a job , done — that plan has come to fruition . the only problem is that there ' s little left to save . windows phone has barely dented the now much larger smartphone market . nokia hasn ' t had a windows phone hit . this incongruity — between a successfully executed , slyly strategic long-term merger plan and a much grander , more general sense of failure — might explain microsoft ' s deeply strange and somewhat sad stated goals for its nokia acquisition .", "microsoft ' s \" strategic rationale , \" titled \" accelerating growth , \" is a disjointed and bizarre document . it manages to sound both insane and uninspiring , outlining modest goals that still sound unrealistic .", "for example , it lays out a plan to pull in over $ 45 billion dollars in smartphone revenue by 2018. but it plans on doing this by securing just 15 % of the projected global smartphone market — not exactly a world-beating plan , keeping in mind the time frame . consider : 2018 is five years away . five years ago was the year the app store first opened .", "there is a pertinent story about a man who was working on an oil platform in the north sea . he woke up one night from a loud explosion , which suddenly set his entire oil platform on fire . in mere moments , he was surrounded by flames . through the smoke and heat , he barely made his way out of the chaos to the platform ' s edge . when he looked down over the edge , all he could see were the dark , cold , foreboding atlantic waters .", "as the fire approached him , the man had mere seconds to react . he could stand on the platform , and inevitably be consumed by the burning flames . or , he could plunge 30 meters in to the freezing waters . the man was standing upon a \" burning platform , \" and he needed to make a choice .", "he decided to jump . it was unexpected . in ordinary circumstances , the man would never consider plunging into icy waters . but these were not ordinary times - his platform was on fire . the man survived the fall and the waters . after he was rescued , he noted that a \" burning platform \" caused a radical change in his behaviour .", "we too , are standing on a \" burning platform , \" and we must decide how we are going to change our behaviour .", "over the past few months , i ' ve shared with you what i ' ve heard from our shareholders , operators , developers , suppliers and from you . today , i ' m going to share what i ' ve learned and what i have come to believe .", "i have learned that we are standing on a burning platform .", "and , we have more than one explosion - we have multiple points of scorching heat that are fuelling a blazing fire around us .", "for example , there is intense heat coming from our competitors , more rapidly than we ever expected . apple disrupted the market by redefining the smartphone and attracting developers to a closed , but very powerful ecosystem .", "in 2008 , apple ' s market share in the $ 300+ price range was 25 percent ; by 2010 it escalated to 61 percent . they are enjoying a tremendous growth trajectory with a 78 percent earnings growth year over year in q4 2010. apple demonstrated that if designed well , consumers would buy a high-priced phone with a great experience and developers would build applications . they changed the game , and today , apple owns the high-end range .", "and then , there is android . in about two years , android created a platform that attracts application developers , service providers and hardware manufacturers . android came in at the high-end , they are now winning the mid-range , and quickly they are going downstream to phones under € 100 . google has become a gravitational force , drawing much of the industry ' s innovation to its core .", "let ' s not forget about the low-end price range . in 2008 , mediatek supplied complete reference designs for phone chipsets , which enabled manufacturers in the shenzhen region of china to produce phones at an unbelievable pace . by some accounts , this ecosystem now produces more than one third of the phones sold globally - taking share from us in emerging markets .", "while competitors poured flames on our market share , what happened at nokia ? we fell behind , we missed big trends , and we lost time . at that time , we thought we were making the right decisions ; but , with the benefit of hindsight , we now find ourselves years behind .", "the first iphone shipped in 2007 , and we still don ' t have a product that is close to their experience . android came on the scene just over 2 years ago , and this week they took our leadership position in smartphone volumes . unbelievable .", "we have some brilliant sources of innovation inside nokia , but we are not bringing it to market fast enough . we thought meego would be a platform for winning high-end smartphones . however , at this rate , by the end of 2011 , we might have only one meego product in the market .", "at the midrange , we have symbian . it has proven to be non-competitive in leading markets like north america . additionally , symbian is proving to be an increasingly difficult environment in which to develop to meet the continuously expanding consumer requirements , leading to slowness in product development and also creating a disadvantage when we seek to take advantage of new hardware platforms . as a result , if we continue like before , we will get further and further behind , while our competitors advance further and further ahead .", "at the lower-end price range , chinese oems are cranking out a device much faster than , as one nokia employee said only partially in jest , \" the time that it takes us to polish a powerpoint presentation . \" they are fast , they are cheap , and they are challenging us .", "and the truly perplexing aspect is that we ' re not even fighting with the right weapons . we are still too often trying to approach each price range on a device-to-device basis .", "the battle of devices has now become a war of ecosystems , where ecosystems include not only the hardware and software of the device , but developers , applications , ecommerce , advertising , search , social applications , location-based services , unified communications and many other things . our competitors aren ' t taking our market share with devices ; they are taking our market share with an entire ecosystem . this means we ' re going to have to decide how we either build , catalyse or join an ecosystem .", "this is one of the decisions we need to make . in the meantime , we ' ve lost market share , we ' ve lost mind share and we ' ve lost time .", "on tuesday , standard &amp; poor ' s informed that they will put our a long term and a-1 short term ratings on negative credit watch . this is a similar rating action to the one that moody ' s took last week . basically it means that during the next few weeks they will make an analysis of nokia , and decide on a possible credit rating downgrade . why are these credit agencies contemplating these changes ? because they are concerned about our competitiveness .", "consumer preference for nokia declined worldwide . in the uk , our brand preference has slipped to 20 percent , which is 8 percent lower than last year . that means only 1 out of 5 people in the uk prefer nokia to other brands . it ' s also down in the other markets , which are traditionally our strongholds : russia , germany , indonesia , uae , and on and on and on .", "how did we get to this point ? why did we fall behind when the world around us evolved ?", "this is what i have been trying to understand . i believe at least some of it has been due to our attitude inside nokia . we poured gasoline on our own burning platform . i believe we have lacked accountability and leadership to align and direct the company through these disruptive times . we had a series of misses . we haven ' t been delivering innovation fast enough . we ' re not collaborating internally .", "we are working on a path forward -- a path to rebuild our market leadership . when we share the new strategy on february 11 , it will be a huge effort to transform our company . but , i believe that together , we can face the challenges ahead of us . together , we can choose to define our future .", "the burning platform , upon which the man found himself , caused the man to shift his behaviour , and take a bold and brave step into an uncertain future . he was able to tell his story . now , we have a great opportunity to do the same ."], "tgt_str": "why did microsoft buy nokia ' s phone business ? we now know microsoft ' s answer : the computing giant released a

wins on some of this term ' s most contentious issues , as the justices consider cases that could gut public sector labor unions and roll back affirmative action at state universities .", "however , as the court ' s new term kicks off monday , uncertainty surrounds several other politically potent cases that could wind up on the court ’ s agenda .", "litigation over state efforts to limit abortion by regulating clinics and doctors is making its way to the high court . and the justices are already facing a batch of petitions involving the rights of religious institutions to opt out of providing contraception under obamacare .", "both issues seem likely to land on this term ' s docket , although the justices haven ’ t formally taken up either .", "many in the obama administration would also like to see the court weigh in on immigration in coming months , upholding the president ’ s right to grant quasi-legal status and work permits to millions of immigrants who entered the u.s. illegally as children .", "but it ’ s unclear whether that fight will get to the justices in time for a decision this term or whether obama ’ s effort to expand his executive actions on immigration will remain blocked by a lower court order until the president leaves office .", "here ’ s politico ’ s look at five of the most important cases the justices could grapple with soon :", "public-employee unions and politicians of both parties are keenly focused on a california dispute about whether states can compel government employees to pay union dues . a loss for the unions could sharply diminish the clout of a movement already struggling with its political relevance .", "the case , friedrichs v. california teachers association , was brought by orange county , calif. schoolteacher rebecca friedrichs and other teachers , who are arguing that forcing them to pay union dues violates their first amendment rights . they also contend that unions should have to get permission before collecting dues used for political purposes , as opposed to the current system that requires objecting employees to opt out .", "“the significance is substantial , either way it comes out , ” said university of california at irvine law professor catherine fisk . “the reason why conservative lawyers are bringing these case is the hope that a significant number of government employees choose not to join the union and certain government employee unions will be weaker. ”", "the roberts court has not been friendly to unions , issuing a 5-4 ruling last year that prohibited mandatory union fees for home health workers but stopped short of banning so-called “agency shops ” in government .", "the new case directly asks the justices to overturn a 38-year-old precedent that allows all workers covered by union negotiations to be charged for representation .", "how the case will be resolved is unclear , partly because the conservative justices often see limits on government employee ’ s first amendment rights when their speech is at issue . fisk said the unions are “rationally fearful ” about what the court will do , but she thinks the justices might end up dumping the case after it ’ s heard . “i think the case raises so many doctrinal problems for them , ” she said .", "two years after punting the case back to an appeals court , the justices will take a second crack at resolving a dispute about the constitutionality of the university of texas at austin ' s affirmative action program . the case was brought by rejected applicant abigail fisher , who contends she was rejected because of her race .", "the last time fisher ’ s case went before the high court , affirmative action opponents hoped it would serve as a vehicle to pare back preferences for racial and ethnic groups at government-run schools . however , the justices instead told the 5th circuit it had been too deferential to the university of texas ’ s claims that the programs were narrowly tailored to promote diversity . justice anthony kennedy won the support of six other justices for a decision that said such programs must be handled with \" strict scrutiny , ” but the decision did not suggest they were automatically unconstitutional .", "justice elena kagan has recused herself because she was involved in the case during her previous service as solicitor general . the real question is whether kennedy will join the four other republican appointees in setting such a high bar for affirmative action that many public colleges will abandon the preferences and admissions practices they use to achieve racial and ethnic diversity .", "a texas case has the potential to deal a blow to latino political clout , tilting the balance of power away from urban areas and towards suburban and rural areas with more white voters . evenwel v. abbott presents the question of whether state legislative districts can be apportioned using a count of eligible voters rather than a count of all people .", "if immigrants ( both illegal and legal ) as well as children can be left out of the count , “the rural areas where voters tend to have fewer non-citizens or where there are fewer young people concentrated would necessarily gain , ” said new york university law professor rick pildes . “it ’ s a reasonable inference if the urban areas are more democratic leaning that they would lose power to more republican rural areas. ”", "congressional redistricting shouldn ’ t be directly affected by the case , pildes said , because the constitution says the u.s. census used for that reapportionment should be based on each state ' s population . but others say the ruling could spill over into congressional redistricting down the line .", "in the hobby lobby case last year , the justices allowed for-profit companies to seek religious exemptions from obamacare ’ s coverage requirements . but now , several religious-affiliated schools and institutions – including the little sisters of the poor nursing home in denver – have filed lawsuits , too .", "they argue that the administration ’ s process for allowing religious nonprofits to opt out of the contraception requirement requires them to violate their religious beliefs . the supreme court has eight petitions – including one that just arrived from the federal government — on this issue .", "some prominent judges are effectively begging the supreme court to jump in by lamenting the refusal of some courts to protect the largely-catholic religious entities from sanctions for failing to fill out paperwork that triggers the contraception exemption but also sets in motion coverage from others .", "“how ironic that this most consequential claim of religious free exercise , with literally millions of dollars in fines and immortal souls on the line , should be denied when nearly every other individual religious freedom claim has been upheld by this court , ” 5th circuit judge edith jones complained in a dissent last week . “how tragic to see the humiliation of sincere religious practitioners , which , coming from the federal government and its courts , implicitly denigrates the orthodoxy to which their lives bear testament . and both ironic and tragic is the harm to the judeo-christian heritage whose practitioners brought religious toleration to full fruition in this nation . undermine this heritage , as our founders knew , and the props of morality and civic virtue will be destroyed. ”", "the justices haven ’ t signaled which of the challenges , if any , they ’ ll consider but are expected to do so in the coming weeks .", "two of the latest tactics in the abortion wars could wind up before the justices this term : requirements that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and that abortion clinics meet standards for hospitals or surgical centers .", "an appeals court has upheld most such limits in texas , but in june the supreme court voted , 5-4 , to block key parts of the law until the justices decide whether to weigh in . petitions to take up that case and a similar law in mississippi are already pending at the supreme court .", "supporters of the laws say they are designed to protect women ' s health , but abortion providers and abortion rights advocates say the laws would force many clinics to close and penalize poor women who could not afford travel to distant clinics .", "a similar wisconsin law led to combative oral arguments in front of the 7th circuit last week . judge richard posner suggested the law was a transparent effort to prevent abortions , not aid women .", "“governor walker , before he withdrew from the presidential competition , said he thought abortion should be forbidden even if the mother dies as a result , \" judge richard posner said to a lawyer for the state , in remarks first reported by the milwaukee journal-sentinel . \" is that kind of official wisconsin policy ? \"", "“that perhaps is governor walker ’ s personal view , but it ’ s not a state policy , ” assistant attorney general brian keenan replied . keenan insisted requiring doctors to have admitting privileges was a reasonable precaution to aid women .", "“the admitting privileges would benefit the continuity of care for the woman when she goes to that hospital , ” he said .", "posner said the fact that the law was intended to kick in one business day after it was passed made clear the authors ' intentions . “that statute can ’ t be justified in terms of women ’ s health , ” the judge said .", "the new term ’ s biggest rulings will land in june , as the 2016 presidential campaign enters its final stretch , and they will help shape the political debate .", "“constitutional law and politics are certainly not the same thing , but they are interrelated , never more so than in a presidential election year that will likely determine who gets to appoint the next justice or two or three , ” said vikram d. amar , dean of the university of illinois college of law .", "by the time the next president is inaugurated , justice stephen g. breyer will be 78 , justices scalia and kennedy will be 80 , and justice ruth bader ginsburg will be 83.", "“this coming term will again put into focus that the court is divided along partisan lines and that the 2016 presidential elections will be hugely consequential in shaping constitutional and other law for perhaps a generation or more , ” said neal e. devins , a law professor at william &amp; mary .", "the current court is the first in history split along partisan lines , where the party of the president who appointed each justice is a reliable predictor of judicial ideology . put another way , all five republican appointees are to the right of all four democratic appointees . it was not long ago that republican appointees like justices john paul stevens and david h. souter routinely voted with the court ’ s liberal wing .", "as a consequence of the current alignment , professor devins said , “the roberts court has generated more marquee decisions divided by party alignment than all other courts combined. ”", "the last term ’ s big cases did not for the most part follow that pattern because justice kennedy , who was appointed by president ronald reagan and sits at the court ’ s ideological fulcrum , voted with the court ’ s liberal wing at an unusually high rate .", "“the story of the last term is that the left side of the court did a lot of winning , ” said irving l. gornstein , the executive director of georgetown ’ s supreme court institute .", "“this term , ” he added , “i would expect a return to the norm , with the right side of the court winning a majority but by no means all of the big cases , with justice kennedy again the key vote. ”", "the cases on unions and affirmative action , for instance , were almost certainly added to the docket by the more conservative justices in the confidence that they would be able to move the law to the right . both cases were created by legal entrepreneurs and brought on behalf of plaintiffs recruited by conservative groups .", "the case on unions , friedrichs v. california teachers association , no . 14-915 , may deal a blow to organized labor . “it could set the stage for a citizens united-style reconsideration in the area of union dues , ” said john p. elwood , a lawyer at vinson &amp; elkins , referring to the 2010 decision that transformed campaign finance law .", "the new case takes aim at a compromise fashioned by the court in 1977 in abood v. detroit board of education .", "in abood , the court said public workers who decline to join a union can nevertheless be required to pay for the union ’ s collective bargaining efforts to prevent freeloading and ensure “labor peace. ” but nonmembers , the court went on , cannot be forced to pay for the union ’ s purely political activities , as that would amount to forbidden compelled speech under the first amendment .", "newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you ' re not a robot by clicking the box . invalid email address . please re-enter . you must select a

spending , seniority , class size and the like . unions respond that the case is a first amendment trojan horse designed to further weaken the power of organized labor .", "the unions have reason to be nervous . the court has twice signaled that it may be ready to overrule abood notwithstanding the doctrine of stare decisis , latin for “to stand by things decided. ” justice alito , the court ’ s leading critic of abood , offered a joking alternative definition in public remarks last month .", "“it is a latin phrase , ” he said . “it means ‘to leave things decided when it suits our purposes. ’ ”", "the case on unions is not the only sequel on the docket .", "in fisher v. university of texas at austin , no . 14-981 , the court will return to the subject of whether the constitution permits public colleges and universities to take account of race in admissions decisions .", "in 2013 , in a short , vague compromise ruling in the case , the court refused to decide whether the admissions plan at the university of texas at austin — which combines race-neutral and race-conscious tools to achieve diversity — is constitutional . the court ’ s return to the subject after an appeals court sustained the hybrid plan has struck many supporters of affirmative action as an ominous sign .", "the case was brought by the project on fair representation , a small conservative advocacy group that successfully mounted a challenge to the voting rights act in 2013. the group is also behind this term ’ s most important case on voting , evenwel v. abbott , no . 14-940 , which asks the court to address the meaning of “one person , one vote. ”", "the court has never resolved whether state voting districts should have the same number of people , including unauthorized immigrants , children and others not eligible to vote , or the same number of voters . allowing states to count only voters would in many parts of the country shift political power from cities to rural areas , a move that would generally benefit republicans .", "on the last day of the term in june , justices breyer and ginsburg announced that they had grave doubts about the constitutionality of the death penalty and seemed to invite a broad challenge . it has not yet arrived , and it is hardly clear that a majority would be receptive to such a challenge .", "the new term does have an unusually high number of capital cases presenting more focused issues , including a challenge to florida ’ s sentencing scheme , hurst v. florida , no . 14-7505 , and a case on race discrimination in jury selection , foster v. chatman , no . 14-8349.", "the court has not heard an abortion case since 2007 , when it upheld the federal partial birth abortion ban act . that seems about to change .", "the most likely candidate is a challenge to a texas law that threatens to reduce the number of abortion clinics in the state to about 10 , down from more than 40. should the court agree to hear the case , whole woman ’ s health center v. cole , no . 15-274 , it is likely to produce the most important abortion ruling since 1992 , when planned parenthood v. casey reaffirmed the constitutional right to abortion identified in roe v. wade in 1973.", "the question in the texas case is whether two parts of a 2013 state law imposed an “undue burden ” on the constitutional right to abortion . one part of the law requires all clinics in the state to meet the standards for “ambulatory surgical centers , ” including regulations concerning buildings , equipment and staffing . the other requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital .", "an appeals court largely upheld the contested provisions , but the supreme court in june , by a 5-to-4 vote , stepped in to block the ruling while it considered whether to hear the case .", "that suggests three things : that the court is likely to hear the case , that its decision will be closely divided and that the ruling will land in june , thrusting a volatile and divisive issue into the middle of the presidential race .", "washington — the death penalty is shaping up to be a big issue for the supreme court as it begins a new term monday , with at least six capital-punishment cases on the docket and a recent wave of executions keeping the justices up late to field last-minute appeals .", "in the weeks ahead , the court is set to hear arguments over the constitutionality of capital sentences in florida , georgia , kansas and pennsylvania . the focus on execution issues follows a 5-4 ruling last term involving a sedative used for lethal injections . the split ..."], "tgt_str": "the supreme court is facing a docket of high-profile political cases that will test whether recent liberal victories were more fluke

inside , woodward said .", "he decided to poke around and , in the basement , woodward found what he believes are colonial-era , hand-hewn and hand-planed joists and foundation walls .", "“found myself in what i am pretty certain is the 1750s historic tavern , ” he said .", "woodward said he felt compelled to investigate in the building , which once housed a chain drugstore and the atlantic garden beer garden , because time was running out .", "“i just realized that it would be the last chance to solve one of the great mysteries of new york city history , ” he said .", "“it was pretty incredible walking back in time 250 years. ”", "historian and author david freeland told silverman that the find “would make it very likely the oldest building remaining in manhattan. ”", "that has woodward hoping city officials will act quickly to preserve the site .", "“what an incredible opportunity that the city suddenly has for this thing to re-emerge , ” he said .", "maybe george washington slept there , or maybe he only watered his horse and ordered stronger stuff for himself . either way , david freeland sounded excited as he crossed the threshold where a famous colonial-era tavern , the bull ’ s head , once welcomed thirsty out-of-towners .", "“there are treasures inside , ” said mr. freeland , an author and a historian who researched the site for a book about a beer garden that later occupied the tavern ’ s place on the bowery .", "but all he saw was debris from the building ’ s most recent life , as a chain drugstore with a chinese restaurant upstairs . he did not reach the treasures that thrilled local-history aficionados over the weekend — namely , some old-looking joists and foundation walls in the basement — because the steps were blocked by rubble . the site is to be cleared for a hotel .", "the joists were discovered by a photographer and preservationist , adam woodward , who suspects that structural elements of the colonial-era tavern were used in the construction of the much larger beer hall , the atlantic garden . it reigned as “one of the show places of new york ” from 1858 on , the new york times said when it finally shut down in 1911.", "but what about the tavern where washington established his temporary headquarters in november 1783 as the british withdrew ?", "“the whole issue of whether the bull ’ s head was buried inside the atlantic garden was one of the great mysteries of new york , ” mr. woodward said .", "until , apparently , the other day , when he got a look inside . he saw iron work from the 19th century and i-beams from later on . and then he saw a stairway to the basement , and headed down .", "“at one point there was a distinct change in the building material , from cinder block to a brick-and-stone foundation wall , ” he said . “i followed that wall and found myself at the front of the building , under the sidewalk at the bowery , and looked up and saw what looked to me like 18th-century hand-hewn and hand-planed joists and beams with extremely wide floorboards right above them. ”", "he said , “i was thinking , i am standing in the cellar of the bull ’ s head. ”", "the bull ’ s head opened around 1750 on the fringe of what was a still-young city concentrated below the bowery . washington and his troops marched down the bowery and stopped there in 1783 before making “their official entrance into the city proper , ” said kerri culhane , a historian who wrote the application that won the bowery a place on the national register of historic places .", "the neighborhood “was a butchers ’ district in the 18th century and the 19th century , ” ms. culhane said . “people drove livestock down from the hinterland and the slaughterhouse was behind the bowery . that ’ s where the trading took place. ”", "it was also a home to the ancestors of future v.i.p. ’ s . “the astors started out as butchers , ” she said , but began snapping up land . they even owned the bull ’ s head site .", "but the tavern closed . mr. freeland wrote that the building became a store that sold stoves until the atlantic garden opened as a beer garden .", "it was a popular gathering place for german immigrants in its early days , and in the 1870s and 1880s , the atlantic garden was raided repeatedly for selling beer on sundays , when the city ’ s excise laws appeared to forbid that . mr. freeland noted that the laws did not mention beer , only “intoxicating liquors or wines. ” the atlantic garden ’ s owner got off after one raid because the judge sampled the beer the police had seized and complained it was so watered down that “a man might drink by the gallon without getting drunk. ”", "later still , the atlantic garden became “a place where tin pan alley songwriters would go to plug their songs , ” mr. freeland said . one tune that apparently got its start there in the 1890s was “daisy bell , ” the song that turned the phrase “bicycle built for two ” into a catchphrase .", "mr. woodward said he hoped the demolition for the hotel could be delayed long enough for “a proper archaeological exploration. ” ( calls to the owner were not returned on monday. )", "“i can ’ t think of another lot in manhattan that has a more important history , ” mr. woodward said , “and the fact that it might be intact , a couple of feet under the building , is an incredible opportunity to get on archaeological record. ”", "elected officials and the landmarks preservation commission are both doing their best to launch a thorough investigation of what may very well be the famed 18th century saloon the bull ' s head tavern , but their options are limited . photographer adam woodward first documented the ancient , hand-planed wood joists and stone foundation in the basement of 50 bowery last week , and both he and historian david freeland are convinced that these are the remnants of bull ' s head . if so , this would be the oldest surviving structure in manhattan by far , and as woodward puts it , an \" incredible opportunity to get on archaeological record . \" but the fate of the site depends on the current owner , alex chu , who is demolishing the site to make way for a new hotel .", "the landmarks commission tells the lo-down that they ' re \" aware of the situation , \" but \" cannot require the owner to conduct archaeology . \" the best they can do is give the owner a list of good archaeologists . some elected officials are also getting involved , but again they ' ve got to take it up with chu first .", "· landmarks commission : no jurisdiction to mandate historic site survey at 50 bowery [ tld ]", "· all coverage of bull ' s head tavern [ ~eny~ ]"], "tgt_str": "in 1783 , after the british soldiers left new york city , george washington is believed to have stopped for a celebratory drink at the bull ' s head tavern . now a preservationist thinks he ' s found the historic site — and if he ' s right , it could be the oldest building in manhattan . adam woodward had heard that the building at 50 bowery , currently scheduled to be demolished so a hotel can go up , might have \" the bull ' s head ' s structure , cellar , bones , \" he tells cbs new york . so he searched the basement , and \" found myself in what i am pretty certain is the 1750s historic tavern , \" he says . specifically , he found what he thinks are hand-hewn and hand-planed joists and foundation walls from the colonial era . since that time , the building has housed a drugstore , a chinese restaurant , and a beer garden , among other things . now he ' s hoping city officials will preserve the site , saying , \" what an incredible opportunity that the city suddenly has for this thing to re-emerge . \" a historian is also convinced it is indeed the old tavern , and investigations have been launched by elected officials and the landmarks preservation commission , eater ny reports . but ultimately , the commission says , it \" cannot require the owner to conduct archaeology , \" so a lot depends on him . he ' s apparently not talking yet ; the new york times couldn ' t get hold of him .", "sim_graph": [["0.9999999", "0.005191372", "0.004846054",
