Code
In order to run our scripts, you first need to download the raw MultiNews data from this link and the ranked WikiSum dataset from here.

After obtaining those datasets you can pre-process the datasets for the specific research question.

For RQ2 you can run either ./scripts/preprocess_multinews.sh or ./scripts/preprocess_wikisum.sh.

For RQ2 you can start the code pipeline with ./scripts/rq2_multinews.sh and ./scripts/rq2_wikisum.sh, within those bashscripts you can set parameters like output directories and more.

Further documentation can be found in the code or our technical report.
