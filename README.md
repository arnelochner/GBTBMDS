In order to run our scripts, you first need to download the raw MultiNews data from [this link](https://github.com/Alex-Fabbri/Multi-News) and the ranked WikiSum dataset from [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/tree/5acf4a44cc2cbe91cd788734075376af0f8dd3f4/tensor2tensor/data_generators/wikisum).

For RQ2 you can run either ./scripts/preprocess_multinews.sh or ./scripts/preprocess_wikisum.sh.

For RQ2 you can start the code pipeline with ./scripts/rq2_multinews.sh and ./scripts/rq2_wikisum.sh, within those bashscripts you can set parameters like output directories and more.

Further documentation can be found in the code or our technical report.
